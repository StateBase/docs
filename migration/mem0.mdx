description: "Upgrade from Mem0 to StateBase"
---

StateBase offers a superset of Mem0's features with better durability and enterprise controls.

## Differences

| Feature | Mem0 | StateBase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage** | Vector Only | Graph + Vector + Relational |
| **Audit** | None | Full Trace Logs |
| **State** | Stateless | Stateful Sessions |

## Migration Script

We provide a utility to import your Mem0 vector dump.

```python
from statebase.migration import import_mem0

import_mem0(
    api_key="sb_live_...",
    mem0_export_path="./mem0_dump.json"
)
```
