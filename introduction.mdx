## Infrastructure for Continuity

StateBase is the **infrastructure layer** for reliable, stateful AI agents. We provide the persistence, memory, and auditability required to transform ephemeral LLM calls into predictable production software.

  <Card title="Quickstart" icon="bolt" href="/quickstart" color="#0EA5E9">
    Build your first stateful agent in **2 minutes**.

    Understand Sessions, State, and Semantic Memory.

## Why StateBase?

Modern AI agents fail not because they aren't smart, but because they are **stateless**. StateBase replaces brittle prompt engineering with deterministic **State Engineering**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Logic Consistency" icon="microchip">
    Deep merge state logic ensures your agent never loses its place in a complex workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-term Knowledge" icon="brain">
    Semantic memory storage allows agents to recall user preferences across months of inactivity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability" icon="eye">
    Decision traces provide every internal monologue and state change for perfect auditability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reliability" icon="rotate-left">
    Instant rollbacks to any previous state version to recover from model hallucinations.
  </Card>
