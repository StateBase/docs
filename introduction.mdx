## What is StateBase?

StateBase is an infrastructure layer designed to solve the "Amalthea Problem" in autonomous agents: **State Drift**.

As agents execute long-running tasks, their context window gets polluted, their logic loops, and they "forget" constraints set in previous turns. StateBase provides a deterministic file system for your agent's mind.

## Why StateBase?

StateBase is built for developers who are done with toy demos and are deploying **mission-critical agents** in Fintech, Healthcare, and Enterprise environments.

1.  **Framework Agnostic**: Works with LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, or raw OpenAI API.
2.  **Zero Latency Overhead**: Asynchronous architecture ensures your UX stays snappy.
3.  **Compliance Ready**: Every state change is hashed and auditable.
