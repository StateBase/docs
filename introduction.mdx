## Imagine your AI had a memory that actually worked.

Most AI agents today are like goldfish. They are brilliant for a single turn, but they forget who the user is, what happened five minutes ago, and why they were doing a task in the first place.

**StateBase is the reliability layer for these agents.** We give your AI a persistent brain, a detailed history, and the ability to "rewind" time when things go wrong.

## Why Reliability Matters

When an agent fails in production—entering a loop or hallucinating—it doesn't just lose a user. It costs you money in tokens and destroys trust in your product.

We replace brittle "prompt engineering" with **State Engineering**.

### What StateBase handles for you:
- **Consistency**: Your agent always knows its "current status."
- **Memory**: It recalls user preferences from months ago, not just the last few messages.
- **Auditability**: You can see every internal thought the agent had before it answered.
- **Safety**: Revert your agent to a "safe" checkpoint if it goes off-rails.

## Built for Engineering Teams

Whether you are using OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models, StateBase acts as the unified persistence layer for your entire agent fleet.
