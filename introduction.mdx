## Ship AI Agents with Confidence

StateBase is the **reliability layer** for production-grade AI agents. We provide the persistence, memory, and auditability required to transform ephemeral LLM calls into predictable, mission-critical software.

## The Engineering of State

Modern AI agents fail not because they aren't smart, but because they are **stateless**. StateBase replaces brittle prompt engineering with deterministic **State Engineering**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Logic Consistency" icon="microchip">
    Deep merge state logic ensures your agent never loses its place in a complex workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-term Knowledge" icon="brain">
    Semantic memory storage allows agents to recall user preferences across months of inactivity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability" icon="eye">
    Decision traces provide every internal monologue and state change for perfect auditability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reliability" icon="rotate-left">
    Instant rollbacks to any previous state version to recover from model hallucinations.
