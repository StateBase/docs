## Memory Formation

StateBase automatically extracts semantic entities from your turns if configured.

1.  **Extraction**: NLP parser identifies proper nouns and facts.
2.  **Deduplication**: Checks against existing Knowledge Graph.
3.  **Upsert**: Updates the `Entity` table.

## Retrieval

When creating a new turn, you can request `context`:

```python
sb.sessions.get_context(
    query="What did the user say about tax law?",
    limit=5
)
```
