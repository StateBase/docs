## Architecture

StateBase uses a copy-on-write mechanism for state storage. Every Turn produces a `Snapshot` hash.

## Rollback

To revert an agent:

```http
POST /v1/sessions/{id}/rollback
Body: { "target_turn_id": "turn_456" }
```

This:
1.  Marks turns after `turn_456` as "orphaned".
2.  Resets the `current_state` pointer to `turn_456`.
3.  Returns the state object of that turn.
