## Sessions

A `Session` is the top-level container for a continuous thread of interaction. It correlates to a unique `session_id`.

```json
{
  "id": "sess_123",
  "agent_id": "finance_v1",
  "created_at": "2026-01-27T10:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "user_tier": "pro"
  }
}
```

## Turns

A `Turn` represents a single atomic state transition—user input, agent loop, and output.
StateBase treats turns as immutable ledger entries.
