StateBase organizes memory into three distinct scopes to ensure relevant retrieval.

## 1. Session Scope (Short-term)
**Lifetime**: Ephemeral (Session duration)
**Use Case**: The current conversation thread. "Refer to the code I just pasted."

Context stored here is automatically prioritized for the immediate next turn but decays rapidly in relevance for future sessions.

## 2. User Scope (Long-term)
**Lifetime**: Permanent (until deleted)
**Use Case**: Personalization. "My name is Sarah", "I prefer Python".

This content follows the `user_id` across *all* agents they interact with in your application.

```python
sb.memory.add(
    user_id="user_123", # <--- Scoped to User
    content="User is a vegetarian."
)
```

## 3. Agent Scope (Knowledge Base)
**Lifetime**: Permanent
**Use Case**: Specialized knowledge. "Our company return policy is 30 days."

This is read-only context available to specific `agent_id` instances, regardless of which user they are talking to.

```python
sb.memory.add(
    agent_id="support_bot_v1", # <--- Scoped to Agent
    content="Support hours are 9am-5pm EST."
)
```

## 4. Global Scope (Organization)
**Lifetime**: Permanent
**Use Case**: World truths. "The sky is blue", "Our stock ticker is $STB".

Available to every agent and user in your workspace.
