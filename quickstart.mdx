**Prerequisite**: Get your API Key from the [StateBase Dashboard](https://app.statebase.org).

## Get Started in 3 Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installation">
    Install the StateBase SDK. It is lightweight, async-first, and has zero heavy machine-learning dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install statebase
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Session">
    Connect to your agent's persistent state. StateBase resolves ownership automatically via your API Key.
    ```python
    from statebase import StateBase
    sb = StateBase(api_key="sb_live_...")
    
    session = sb.sessions.create(
        agent_id="support-bot-v1",
        initial_state={"status": "onboarding"}
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve & Persist">
    Fetch consolidated context (State + Memories) and save interactions.
    ```python
    # Fetch context
    context = sb.sessions.get_context(session_id=session.id, query="Hello!")
    
    # Save interaction
    sb.sessions.add_turn(
        session_id=session.id,
        input="Hello!",
        output="Hi! I remember you."
    )
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Verify on the Dashboard

Head over to the [StateBase Dashboard](https://app.statebase.org/dashboard/sessions) to see your session in action. You'll find:

- **Complete Trace**: Real-time log of every turn.
- **State Diff**: Exactly how the agent's internal state changed.
- **Memory Bank**: Key facts the agent has extracted and saved for the long term.
