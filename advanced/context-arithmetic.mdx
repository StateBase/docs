StateBase allows you to perform **Set Operations** on context contexts.

## Union (Merge)

Combine User Context + Global Company Context.

```python
user_ctx = sb.context.get(user_id="user_123")
corp_ctx = sb.context.get(org_id="corp_abc")

full_context = user_ctx + corp_ctx
```

## Intersection (Commonality)

Find shared knowledge between two users.

```python
shared_context = ctx_user_a & ctx_user_b
```

## Subtraction (Privacy)

Remove sensitive PII from a context before sending to LLM.

```python
safe_context = full_context - sensitive_topics
```
